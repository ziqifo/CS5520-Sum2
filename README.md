# Signup App
This project implements a signup process for a mobile application. 

1. **Starting screen**: Where users enter their email and phone number.
2. **Confirmation screen**: Displays the entered information in a modal for users to confirm or edit.
3. **Finish screen**: If the users have confirmed their information, they are shown a thank you message along with an image generated based on the last digit of their phone number. If they chose to finish the process later, a sad smiley face is displayed.
